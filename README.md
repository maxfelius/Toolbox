In this repo I want to make some tools to improve productivity

Tools (finished):


Tools to be made:
-Package to test function
->Testing will involve (runtime, memory use,...)

-Internet Connection Tester
->Simple script which pings an address and logs the result

-Clipboard storer
->Script that stores clipboard items

-CLI Google searcher
->Searches google and opens the first link in the background
->Should improve quickly looking up small programming issues
->Preference to open Stackoverflow
->Preference to immediately show the solution

-Automated pdf file seperator/merger/rotator

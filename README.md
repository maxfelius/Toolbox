In this repo I want to make some tools to improve productivity

# Tools (finished):
1. Automated pdf file seperator/merger/rotator

2. Internet Connection Tester
- Simple script which pings an address and logs the result

# Tools to be made (ideas):
1. Clipboard storer
- Script that stores clipboard items
- Should save output of terminal command to clipboard
- easy pasting into terminal

2. CLI Google searcher
- Searches google and opens the first link in the background
- Should improve quickly looking up small programming issues
- Preference to open Stackoverflow
- Preference to immediately show the solution

3. Create Shell Script to add python scripts to the environmental variables of the terminal

4. Automatic Latex Table Creator

5. Webscraper that looks at a particular website everyday for updates
